# Gunn Elimination 2024

The 2024 Elimination website is developed using the SUKIT tech stack (Supabase, SvelteKit). I'm not using Firebase cuz FKIT. Please open a pull request if you want to contribute.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
